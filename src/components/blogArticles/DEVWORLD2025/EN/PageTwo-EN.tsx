        I attended DEVWorld 2025 because I was curious to see how other professionals work 
        and what projects they are involved in. The event had an international setting, 
        so everyone spoke English, which made the experience enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the discussions, it was inspiring to see how technology is used for 
        software internationalization, sustainable software, and AI implementations. 
        When I shared my experience at the municipality and our project, many people were excited 
        and showed genuine interest and appreciation for{' '}

      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        My experience at DEVWorld 2025 was very positive, thanks to the well-organized event 
        and inspiring setting. At the Datadog booth, I got a demo of their Azure integration. 
        I was surprised how easy and visually appealing it was to track errors, 
        especially since Datadog makes monitoring and log analysis more efficient than using Azure alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the <strong>Future of AI panel discussion</strong> was fascinating. 
        The insights on vector databases and AI implementations in companies 
        gave me a clearer picture of how these technologies are used. 
        I also found Bright Data‚Äôs talk on data scraping for AI model training very valuable. 
        This might be something that could be applied within the municipality to train our own AI agents 
        and feed models with relevant data.

      <h2>International Collaboration and Networking</h2>
      <p>
        At DEVWorld 2025, I had the opportunity to network with various professionals, 
        including developers from Japan. They emphasized the need for European inspiration 
        within the Japanese tech sector and suggested that an exchange between the 
        Municipality of Amsterdam and companies, or even the municipality of Tokyo, 
        could be beneficial.
      </p>
      <h2>Potential Collaboration Between Amsterdam and Tokyo</h2>
      <p>
        Japan needs more IT talent, faster adoption of new technologies, 
        and modern, user-friendly web designs. Amsterdam, on the other hand, 
        can contribute expertise in innovation, UX, and cloud solutions, 
        making collaboration between the two cities highly valuable.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        DEVWorld 2025 was an inspiring event that showcased the latest technological 
        developments and networking opportunities. For developers and tech leaders, 
        it is definitely a conference worth attending.
