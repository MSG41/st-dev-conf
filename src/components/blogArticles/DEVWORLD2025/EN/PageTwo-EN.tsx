          This year‚Äôs focus included Agentic AI, data scraping, LLM
          implementations, and DevOps innovation. I attended DEVWorld 2025 to
          learn how other professionals work and what kind of projects they‚Äôre
          involved in. It was also a very international setting, so everyone
          spoke English, which was a pleasant experience.

          During the sessions, it was inspiring to see how tech is being used
          for software internationalization, sustainable software, and AI
          implementations. When I shared my experience at the municipality and
          our project{' '}

          My experience at DEVWorld 2025 was very positive thanks to the great
          organization and inspiring setting. At the Datadog booth, I got a live
          demo of their Azure integration. I was impressed by how visual and
          easy it was to trace errors. Datadog‚Äôs monitoring and log analysis
          felt more efficient than Azure‚Äôs default tools.

        <Paragraph>
          The Future of AI panel was also super insightful. I gained a clearer
          picture of how vector databases and AI deployments are being used
          across industries. Bright Data‚Äôs talk on scraping data to feed AI
          models was a highlight‚Äîit‚Äôs something I could imagine applying at the
          municipality to train our own agents with more relevant data.
