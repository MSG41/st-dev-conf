          This year‚Äôs focus included Agentic AI, data scraping, LLM
          implementations, and DevOps innovation. I attended DEVWorld 2025 to
          have a closer look at how other professionals work and what kind of
          projects they‚Äôre involved in. It was also a very international
          setting, so everyone spoke English, which was a pleasant experience.

          During the sessions, it was inspiring to see how tech is being used
          for software internationalization, sustainable software, and AI
          implementations. When I shared my experience at the municipality and
          showed our project{' '}

          My experience at DEVWorld 2025 was very positive thanks to the great
          organization and inspiring setting. At the Datadog booth, I got a live
          demo of their Azure integration. I was impressed by how visual and
          easy it was to trace errors. Datadog‚Äôs monitoring and log analysis
          felt more efficient than Azure‚Äôs default tools.

          The Future of AI panel was also super insightful. I gained a clearer
          picture of how vector databases and AI deployments are being used
          across industries. Bright Data‚Äôs talk on scraping data to feed AI
          models was a highlight, it‚Äôs something I could imagine the Municipality
          apply to train our own AI agents.
