              I am Salim Thaifa, a Fullstack Developer at the Municipality of
              Amsterdam, with a background in civil engineering and a passion
              for technology and software development. I enjoy working on
              challenging projects and continuously developing myself in an
              ever-evolving technological landscape.

            <Paragraph>
              I wanted to create a space to gather all my notes, experiences,
              and thoughts from the conferences I‚Äôve attended and share my
              insights with others. With many more conferences planned in the
              future, it‚Äôs nice to have everything in one place for easy
              reference. Additionally, this blog gives me the perfect
              opportunity to work with the thoughtfully designed Amsterdam
              Design System
              <Mark>‚Äîhats off to the talented team behind it!</Mark> It‚Äôs been a
              truly enjoyable experience to use it in this context.
